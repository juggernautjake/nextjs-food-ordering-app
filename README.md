# nextjs-food-ordering-app
This is a concept project to aid in better understanding full-stack development. In this project I built a food ordering app that allows for restaurants to post their menus and promotions and for customers to make mobile orders. The project emphasizes user authentication and API calls to the database for both user and restaurant data.
